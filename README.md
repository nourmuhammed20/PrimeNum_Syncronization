Buffering Simulation - Prime Number Producer-Consumer
=====================================================

This project is developed as part of the Operating System course assignment at the Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence, Cairo University. The goal of the project is to simulate a real-life scenario of buffering, where a producer generates prime numbers and schedules them in a queue, and a consumer writes these numbers to a file. The implementation utilizes multiple threads to perform these actions concurrently, reducing the overall elapsed time. 🚀

Features ✨
----------

*   Generate prime numbers from 0 to N, where N is a user-defined input. 🔢
*   Producer schedules the prime numbers in a queue. 📊
*   Consumer thread retrieves prime numbers from the queue and writes them to a file. 📝
*   Multiple threads enable parallel execution, improving efficiency. 🔄
*   Synchronization mechanisms ensure proper coordination between threads. ⚙️
*   Graphical User Interface (GUI) provides real-time updates. 🖥️

Usage 📚
--------

1.  Clone the project repository to your local machine. 📂
2.  Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. ☕
3.  Open the project in your preferred Java IDE. 💻
4.  Locate the main class, typically named `Main` or `Application`. 📑
5.  Compile and run the program. ▶️
